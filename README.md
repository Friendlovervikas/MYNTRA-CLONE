# Mytra Clone

A front-end-only replica of **Mytra**, an e-commerce platform, built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This clone mimics essential features like product listing, search functionality, a shopping cart, and checkout flow. The project serves as a practice for creating an interactive e-commerce website without the need for a backend.

## Features

- **Product Listings**: Browse and view products categorized into different sections.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for products by name or category.
- **Add to Cart**: Add products to the shopping cart.
- **View Cart**: View the products in your cart, remove items, and adjust quantities.
- **Simulated Checkout**: A mock checkout process with order confirmation.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive design that adapts to both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Local Storage**: Cart data is saved in the browser’s local storage for persistence even after page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for creating the structure of the website (product listings, cart, etc.).
- **CSS**: Used to style the application, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Provides interactivity, such as adding/removing products from the cart, updating cart totals, and handling the checkout process.
- **Local Storage**: Used to persist the shopping cart data across page reloads.

## How It Works

1. **Browse Products**: View a list of products in various categories.
2. **Search Products**: Use the search bar to find specific products.
3. **Add to Cart**: Click on the "Add to Cart" button to add an item to your cart.
4. **View Cart**: Click the cart icon to view all added items, remove items, or adjust quantities.
5. **Checkout**: Once ready, proceed to the checkout page where you can review your order (no real payment processing).
6. **Persistence**: The shopping cart is saved in the browser’s local storage, so even if you reload the page, the cart data remains.
